Hi [First Name],

Ready to level up your design game? Here are the insider secrets our best designers use to create showstopping custom apparel:

**🎯 Tip #1: Be Specific with Colors**
Instead of "blue design," try "ocean blue with white accents" or "navy blue with gold highlights." Our AI loves color details!

**🎨 Tip #2: Include Mood and Style**
Add feeling words like "minimalist and clean," "vintage and weathered," or "bold and energetic" to guide the AI's creative direction.

**✨ Tip #3: Perfect Your Text**
Put any text you want in quotes: "Adventure Awaits" or "Coffee & Kindness" - this ensures perfect spelling and placement.

**💡 Bonus Tip**: Try multiple variations! Each generation gives you a unique interpretation of your idea.
