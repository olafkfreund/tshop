# TShop FAQ & Support Content

## Getting Started FAQ

### What is TShop?
TShop is an AI-powered custom apparel platform that helps anyone create professional designs for t-shirts, caps, and tote bags. You simply describe your idea to our AI, and it generates professional designs optimized for your chosen product. No design skills required!

### How does the AI design process work?
1. **Choose your product** (t-shirt, cap, or tote bag)
2. **Describe your vision** in plain language (e.g., "mountain landscape with 'Adventure Awaits' text")
3. **Select a style direction** (minimal, vintage, bold, or artistic)
4. **Watch AI create** your professional design in about 30 seconds
5. **Preview in 3D** to see exactly how it looks
6. **Refine if needed** or generate variations
7. **Order your custom item** with professional printing and shipping

### Is TShop really free to try?
Yes! Everyone gets 2 free AI design generations to experience the platform. No credit card required. After that, creating a free account gives you 10 generations every single day, forever.

### What's the difference between the account types?
- **Visitor**: 2 total free generations
- **Free Account**: 10 generations daily (resets every 24 hours)
- **Premium**: 100 generations monthly + priority processing + advanced features ($9.99/month)

### Do I need design experience?
Not at all! That's the whole point of TShop. Our AI is trained to create professional designs from simple descriptions. If you can describe what you want, you can create amazing custom apparel.

## AI Design Tool FAQ

### How specific should I be in my design description?
The more specific, the better! Instead of "cool design," try "minimalist mountain landscape in navy blue with bold white text saying 'Adventure Awaits'." Include:
- Visual elements you want
- Color preferences
- Text content (in quotes)
- Style mood (modern, vintage, playful, etc.)

### Can I include text in my designs?
Absolutely! Put any text you want in quotes within your description. For example: "Vintage coffee shop logo with 'Daily Grind Cafe' in retro lettering." The AI will ensure proper spelling and placement.

### What if I don't like the generated design?
No problem! You have several options:
- **Generate variations**: Create different versions of the same concept
- **Refine your design**: Tell the AI what to adjust (colors, text size, etc.)
- **Start over**: Try a completely different description
- **Get inspired**: Browse our community gallery for ideas

### Why does the AI optimize differently for each product?
Each product has unique design considerations:
- **T-shirts**: Chest area placement, readability across body types
- **Caps**: Curved surface adaptation, front panel focus
- **Tote bags**: Large canvas opportunities, everyday visibility

Our AI understands these differences and creates designs that work perfectly for your chosen product.

### Can I create copyrighted or branded designs?
No. Our AI is trained to avoid copyrighted material, trademarked logos, and branded content. Focus on original ideas, personal messages, or general themes rather than specific brand names or copyrighted characters.

### How many variations can I generate?
Each use of the AI design tool counts as one generation toward your limit. You can generate as many variations as you have generations available:
- Free account: 10 daily
- Premium: 100 monthly

## 3D Preview & AR FAQ

### How accurate is the 3D preview?
Very accurate! Our 3D previews show realistic fabric textures, accurate colors, and proper sizing. What you see is what you'll receive. The previews help eliminate purchase uncertainty.

For cap designs:
1. Complete your cap design
2. Tap "Try with AR" on mobile
3. Allow camera access
4. Point your phone at your head
5. See the cap appear virtually in real-time
6. Take photos or videos to share

The AR feature works on most modern smartphones and helps you see exactly how the cap fits and looks.

### Can I share my 3D previews?
Yes! You can save images of your 3D preview and share them on social media, with friends, or in our community gallery. Many customers share previews to get feedback before ordering.

### Do all products have 3D preview?
Yes! Every design on every product gets a 3D preview. T-shirts show on realistic body models, caps display on head models, and tote bags appear as they would when carried.
