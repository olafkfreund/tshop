## The Problem

### Limited Access to Professional Design

Most people want custom apparel but lack design skills or can't afford professional designers. This creates a barrier between wanting personalized products and actually getting them.

**Our Solution:** AI-powered instant design generation makes professional-quality designs accessible to everyone.

### Complex Fulfillment Process

Creating custom apparel involves managing design files, finding manufacturers, handling orders, and shipping logistics. This complexity prevents many from pursuing custom merchandise.

**Our Solution:** Integrated fulfillment with Printful and Printify handles the entire process from design to delivery.

### High Costs and Minimums

Traditional custom apparel requires large minimum orders and expensive setup fees, making it inaccessible for individuals and small businesses.

**Our Solution:** On-demand printing with no minimums and dual fulfillment options (premium and cost-effective) for different budgets.

## Differentiators

### AI-First Design Approach

Unlike traditional custom apparel platforms that require manual design work, we provide instant AI-generated designs tailored to user preferences. This results in professional-quality designs in seconds rather than hours.

### Dual Fulfillment Strategy

Unlike competitors who use single fulfillment partners, we offer both premium (Printful) and cost-effective (Printify) options. This results in flexible pricing that serves both quality-conscious and budget-conscious customers.

### Interactive Design Editor

Unlike static design tools, we integrate Fabric.js for real-time design editing and customization. This results in a smooth, intuitive design experience that rivals professional software.
