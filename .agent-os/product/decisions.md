**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

TShop is an AI-powered custom apparel platform focusing on t-shirts, caps, and tote bags with integrated AI design generation and dual fulfillment strategy (Printful premium + Printify cost-effective).

### Context

The custom apparel market lacks accessible tools for professional design creation. Most platforms require design skills or expensive services, creating barriers for individuals and small businesses wanting personalized products. There's an opportunity to democratize custom apparel through AI assistance.

### Alternatives Considered

   - Cons: No fulfillment integration, incomplete solution

3. **Single Fulfillment Partner**
   - Pros: Simpler integration, consistent experience
   - Cons: Limited pricing flexibility, vendor lock-in

### Rationale

- AI democratizes professional design creation
- Dual fulfillment provides pricing flexibility for different customer segments
- Focus on 3 core products allows for quality and specialization
- Modern tech stack enables rapid development and scaling

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Accessible professional design creation for everyone

### Decision

Implement product-specific AI prompt engineering with automated design constraints and modern preview system for all products (t-shirts, caps, tote bags).

### Context

AI-generated designs must be optimized for each product type with proper sizing, backgrounds, and positioning. Customers need intuitive prompting and realistic previews to make purchasing decisions.

### Requirements

**AI Prompt Engineering:**

- Design style guidance (apparel-appropriate graphics, text readability)
- Automatic constraint injection based on selected product

**Modern Preview System:**
- Realistic product mockups showing design in context
- Multiple angles/views per product type
- Dynamic preview updates during design editing
- High-quality rendering for purchase confidence

### Rationale

Proper constraints ensure AI generates apparel-appropriate designs automatically, reducing user frustration and returns. Professional previews increase conversion rates and customer satisfaction.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Designer, AR Developer

### Decision

Implement "Cap Camera" feature using device camera (mobile/webcam) for real-time cap try-on with custom designs overlaid using AR technology.

### Context

Customers struggle to visualize how caps will look on them, especially with custom designs. AR try-on significantly increases conversion rates and reduces returns by providing confident purchase decisions.

### Technical Approach

**AR Implementation:**
- WebRTC for camera access (mobile/desktop)
- Face detection and tracking (MediaPipe or similar)

- Product pages: Try-on before purchase
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Progressive enhancement (fallback to static preview)

### Rationale

AR try-on is becoming standard for fashion e-commerce. Caps are perfect for AR since they have consistent positioning and sizing. This feature will be a major differentiator and conversion driver.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Significantly higher conversion rates for caps
- Reduced returns and customer satisfaction issues
- Major competitive differentiation
- Viral marketing potential (shareable AR experiences)

**Negative:**
- Complex AR development and testing
- Performance considerations on lower-end devices
- Additional camera permissions and privacy concerns
- Increased development timeline

- Dynamic lighting and shadows
- Design placement accuracy with wrinkle/drape effects
- Color variants (white, black, heather, etc.)

**Performance Optimization:**
- Progressive loading with fallback to 2D
- LOD (Level of Detail) for different devices
- Texture compression and caching
- Mobile-optimized rendering

### Integration Points

- Design editor: Real-time 3D preview during design creation
- Product pages: Interactive 3D showcase
- Shopping cart: 3D thumbnails
- Mobile responsive with touch controls

### Rationale

Premium 3D visualization positions TShop as a high-end platform, increases conversion rates, and reduces returns by providing accurate expectations of the final product.
